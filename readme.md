# journal

this is the code i use to process my audio journal. ever since 2018, i have been recording journal entries via voice memo on my phone. as of 2023, i now use a dedicated device.

as of 2024 this also processes video journals, most of which are taken on a camcorder from 2006, but others are from my phone's camera or other media.
